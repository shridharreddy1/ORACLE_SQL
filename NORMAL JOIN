NORMAL JOIN :

1.SELF JOIN   : It is a process of joining the data of a table with the data of the same table.
                Syn: select .......... from <table 1> join <table 2> on (joining cond) ;
                     select * from  emp e join dept d on (e.deptno=d.deptno);
                   
2.OUTER JOIN : If the data is extracted from multiple tables such that the records which are not satisfying the condition are 
               also displayed . It is called OUTER-JOIN.
               
               The join which displays only the record which are satisfying the condition are called as the inner join.
               select ename,empno from emp e 
               inner join dept d 
               on (e.deptno = d.deptno);
               
               Outer join are of two types: 
               
               1. <table1> left outer join <table2> on <condition>
                  <table1> is non-matching record.
                  NOTE: It displays the non-matching record from the <TABLE1> 
                  
               2. <table1> right outer join <table2> on <condition>
                  <table2> is non-matching record.
                  NOTE: It displays the non-matching record from the <TABLE2>
                  
               3. <table1> full outer join <table2> on <condition>
                  <table2>,<table2> is non-matching record.
                  NOTE: It displays the non-matching record from the <TABLE1> & <TABLE2>
 
 3. CROSS JOIN : It is a process of extracting the data from multiple table without  a joining condition, These join are used to 
                 to generate the available combination based on the data in a table.
                 Syn: select ..........from <TABLE1> cross join <TABLE2>;
                      select * from emp cross join dept;
