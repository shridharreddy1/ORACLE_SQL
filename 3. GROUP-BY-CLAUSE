It is used to group the records based on a column or columns when a group is created automatically 
eliminates the duplicates values from that columns.

GROUP-BY / MULTI-ROW FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SUM(N1) :Return the sum of the not null values in a group of values. 
2. AVG(N1) :Return the avg of the not null values in a group of values.
3. MIN(EXP1) :Return the min of the not null values in a group of values.
4. MAX(EXP1) :Return the max of the not null values in a group of values.
5. COUNT(EXP1/*) : Return the count of the not null values in a group of values / Return the number of rows in a group of rows .


HAVING-BY CLAUSE / MULTI-ROW FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is used to compare the o/p of a multi-row function i.e It is used to filter the groups based on the user defined condition(s).

Select ...............<table name>
[where clause] [ group by clause ]
having <condition> and/or <condition2>......................

NOTE: If the 'where' & 'group by' clauses are based on same column then it is recommended to replace "where" clause by having 
clause to improve the performance.

select deptno,sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) >9000

select mgr,count(*) from emp
where mgr is not null
group by mgr
having count(*)>=2

select mgr,count(*) from emp
group by mgr
having count(*)>=2 and mgr is not null
